# Genomic Disruption

This directory contains genomic disruption experiments.

## Experiments:

### 1. disruption_by_permutation/
Experiment involving disruption by permutation of mouse CTCF sites and correlating disruption scores with genomic features.

### 2. reverse_complement/
Experiment comparing the disruption scores for mouse CTCF sites between DNA strands (default strand and its reverse complement).

### 3. shifted_permutations/
Experiment permuting mouse CTCF sites for windows shifted up to 10kb and comparing scores with the centered predictions.
